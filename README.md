# Automated-Airsoft-Turret
Over the summer I worked on a project for fun to track and fire an airsoft gun at geese walking on the lawn. The airsoft turret used 2 motors, a camera and LIDAR, a raspberry pi 4 (with motor hat and thermal case), coral TPU, and wooden/3D printed supports. Due to the motors being weak the final version was not able to move the airsoft gun since it was too heavy.
